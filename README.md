I build to upgrade our SNS Academy website by enhancing the UI/UX.

This is a full-stack project that serves a React client (Vite) and a Node/Express server. It's ready to run locally and purpose-built for a modern tech, UI-focused site.

## Features
- React + Vite front-end (client/)
- TailwindCSS styling
- Express backend with Vite middleware for dev
- Build pipeline that bundles server and client for production
- Drizzle ORM (drizzle-kit) for database migrations

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Dharshini\Downloads\ModernTechFrontend\ModernTechFrontend"
npm install

# Development (PowerShell):
$env:NODE_ENV = 'development'; $env:HOST = '127.0.0.1'; $env:PORT = '5001'; npx tsx server/index-dev.ts

# Build & run (production)
npm run build
$env:HOST = '127.0.0.1'; $env:PORT = '5001'; node dist/index.js
```

## Notes
- If the server cannot bind to `0.0.0.0:5000` due to environment, set `HOST` to `127.0.0.1` and change `PORT` as necessary.
- To support cross-platform env settings in `package.json`, consider using `cross-env`.

## Contributing
PRs welcome — follow the code style in `tsconfig.json` and `lint` if applicable.
